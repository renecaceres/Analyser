This source code it is used to work with the clas_42011_01_1.pass2.root file.


The 'main.C' macro reads the ROOT file and creates the Betta versus Moment
histograms (TH2F and TProfile) for every particle, and saves them in two
files, 'particle_histograms.root' and 'particle_profiles.root'. The TProfile
objects are used to fit the betta function. An executable version of the macro
it is created by the Makefile.

Now you can use the macros 'show_hist.C' to see the TH2F histograms,
'show_prof.C' to see the TProfile histograms and 'show_fit.C' to see the
fitting of the betta function (which is in the 'betta.C' file).


An alternative way is provided by the 'write_tree.C' macro. It creates a TTree
with branches for betta, moment and particle_id values of every particle. This
tree is saved in the 'particle_data.root' file. An executable version of the
macro it is created by the Makefile. Then you can use the 'getFit.C' macro to
show the fitting of the particle given as parameter to the macro.


The 'mass_distribution.C' macro creates the Mass versus Moment histograms
(TH2F and TProfile) for every particle with positive charge and StatSC > 1.
The histograms are saved in the 'particle_mass_dist.root' file. You can use
the macro 'show_mass_dist.C' to show them.
